# Module 5 Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I built a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day so that they can manage their time effectively. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I used the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time.

## Usage

When you visit the application, you will be presented with a daily planner where you can create a schedule for your work day. When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down, you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours and each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. When you click into a timeblock, you can type in an event and click save. When you click the save button, the text for that event is saved in local storage and a message is shown at the top of the planner for 5 seconds notifying you that the event was saved. When you refresh the page, the saved events persist.
